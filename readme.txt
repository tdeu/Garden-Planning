The aim of this project is to build an interactive map of my land, add exisiting elements in a static manner, and let user add/remove any element he wishes to. 

Photographs of the existing elements (tree, hedge, water tank, lagoon, pavements) will be linked and saved on the solana blockchain.
The evolution of the nature will be kept track of, on the blockchain. 


Existing elements are: 
- Trees (3)
- Hedge (3 ranges)
- Water tank for gardening
- Pavements

Non-existing elements are: 
-Lagoon (to be built Spring 2025) and pool
- Yellow Stones walls
- Veggie garden
- Chicken coop
-
